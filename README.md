# Lab

**You will use the nature_of_numbers.py file to write your code.**

Computers are super fast and accurate at calculating. As a result, understanding this and gaining experience in writing programs that perform calculations will significantly enhance your skill set and resume. 

**In this lab, you will:**

- Ask for and perform calculations on numbers.
- Using the number provided by the user, you will discover and report:
  - If the number is even or odd (zero is even!).
  - If the number has a perfect square root.
  - All the factors of a number.
 
**Example Run:**
```Enter a whole number (i.e., an integer): 24

The number you entered is 24.
24 is an even number.
24 does not have a perfect square root.
The factors of 24 are 1,2,3,4,6,8,12,24.

Would you like to enter another number? Y

Please enter a whole number (i.e., an integer): 496

The number you entered is 496.
496 is an even number.
496 does not have a perfect square root.
The factors of 496 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 31, 62, 124, 248, 496.


Would you like to enter another number? N
